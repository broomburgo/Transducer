# Transducer
Basic Transducer implementation in Swift.

This is heavily influenced by the [learn-transducers-playground](https://github.com/mbrandonw/learn-transducers-playground) by Brandon Williams, but it defines a 'Transducer' type with methods.

Please don't use this. Read it, learn from it, puke on it if you need to, but don't use it as-it-is: write a new version from scratch, think about better abstractions, make it yours.

Please don't outsource knowledge, you'll regret it.
